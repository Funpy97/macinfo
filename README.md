from subprocess import check_output
from typing import List


def get_mac_addresses() -> List[str]:
    output = check_output("getmac")
    mac_addresses = []

    for line in output.splitlines():
        if b" " in line:
            splitted_line = line.split()
            if b"-" in splitted_line[0]:
                mac_addresses.append(splitted_line[0].decode())

    return mac_addresses


if __name__ == "__main__":
    for mac_address in get_mac_addresses():
        try:
            company = search_company_by_mac(mac_address=mac_address)[0]
